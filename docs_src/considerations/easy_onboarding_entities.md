# Easy onboarding of companies (especially SMEs)

For the use case of issuing responsible declarations from a company involving an employee, the onboarding process for those companies should be easy and as decentralized as possible, to enable mass onboarding. The level of assurance of the identity of the company should be just enough for the needs of the use case. This is especially true for SMEs, where the amount of resources and technical skills required should be kept to the minimum possible.

Please note that in this use case (issuing responsible declarations), the onboarding process does not have to provide information on what type of combany or the type of business of the company.

The following paragraphs describe several options that can be used, each with some advantages and disadvantages. Due to their simplicity, a combination of several ofpions can be implemented simultaneously, to provide more options to the companies.

## Easy onboarding using IETF 8615 Well-Known Uniform Resource Identifiers

Using the [IETF 8615 Well-Known Uniform Resource Identifiers](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8615), the DIF (Decentralized Identity Foundation) has [specified](https://identity.foundation/specs/did-configuration/) one way to facilitate the connection of existing systems and Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), which is important to facilitate adoption of DIDs in the enterprise arena. The idea is to use the ability of a DID controller to prove it is the same entity that controls an Internet domain.

The entity has to provide proof of a bi-directional relationship between the controller of an Internet domain and a DID via cryptographically verifiable signatures that are linked to a DID's key material.

The details can be found in the DIF document ['Well Known DID Configuration'](https://identity.foundation/specs/did-configuration/) but essentially it means that the DID Configuration resource MUST exist at the domain root, in the IETF 8615 Well-Known Resource directory, as follows.

Assume that an entity has the following domain: `example.com`.
Then at the URL `https://www.example.com/.well-known/did-configuration` there should be a document like the following, with a JSON object containing a DID string and cryptographic proof (in the form of a JWT signed with the specified DID's keys) that verifies **the domain controller and the DID controller are the same entity**.

```json
{
  "entries": [
    {
      "did": "did:ala:quor:redt:123...",
      "jwt": "ewogICJAY29udGV4dCI..."
              â†‘ EXAMPLE OF DECODED JWT VALUE
              {
                "iss": "did:ala:quor:redt:123...",
                "domain": "example.com",
                "exp": 1475878357
              }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Easy onboarding using an existing traditional digital certificate

Many companies or representatives of those companies already possess a "traditional" digital certificate. This could be used to implement an autonomous onboarding process.
