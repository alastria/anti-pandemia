# Introduction

There are five types of entities that have to be onboarded in the system:

1. **Citizens**: the citizen will receive credentials from practitioners and health institutions, and will be able to present those credentials for verification  (and maybe for service provision) by professionals and other institutions.

2. **Practitioners**: this is a general term used to denote all those professionals who can create and issue some specific types of credentials to the citizens. The term includes doctors and other health-related staff, but it can also denote some other professionals that can issuse credentials in some circumstances, like a police officer. They can issue credentials directly, without using any intermediate computer system of an intitution. This term can also include in some countries private labs which coordinate with the national health system but act independently.

3. **Health institutions**: they can issue many types of credentials, via their computer systems. Those credentials are normally issued by employees of the institution using its computer systems, but the employees do not appear here. These employees do not have to be confused with the **practitioner** entity, which is a natural person that can issue credentials directly and independently from the health institution.

4. **Officials**: the term refers in general to those professionals who can verify credentials presented by citizens. They can make the verification directly, in the same way that practitioners can issue credentials directly. One example is a police officer checking in the street that a citizen holds an appropriate credential signed by a practitioner. Even though the term does not imply it, any citizen can also verify any credential presented by any other citizen. In this case, the citizen is acting in the role of an official.

5. **Service providers**: the term refers to any type of institution that can verify credentials presented by citizens or that can accept those credentials for the provision of some service.
