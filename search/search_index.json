They are the equivalent to the citizen using the self-diagnostics questionnaires to get advice, or to the functionality in some applications to help track quarantine and confinement. Third-party credentials : credentials issued by third parties stating a fact about the subject. For example, a certification of immunisation or a certificate from a company stating that a given employee is required for essential works at some time in some place. The following sections describe some of the possible credentials managed by the system, but they can be added or modified as required. 1.

These immunity certificates could let people to leave the pandemia lockdown earlier than the rest of the population if they test positive for antibodies to the virus. Even when the lockdown is released, some partial restrictions may be in place and these certificates could allow some people to move more freely and to more places. 1.2 Safe conduct (as a responsible declaration) In this context a Safe conduct , or letter of transit , is a certificate issued to a person to allow that person to move to some place with a given purpose. Electronic equivalent of a responsible declaration issued by a company/employer to an employee to allow her to move.

There are five types of entities that have to be onboarded in the system: Citizens : the citizen will receive credentials from practitioners and health institutions, and will be able to present those

The term includes doctors and other health-related staff, but it can also denote some other professionals that can issuse credentials in some circumstances, like a police officer. They can issue credentials directly, without using any intermediate computer system of an intitution. This term can also include in some countries private labs which coordinate with the national health system but act independently.

Citizens ESSIF-MVP1 and the current AlastriaID implementation use \u201cclassic\u201d ledger-based DIDs (i.e. DIDs registered on a Blockchain). In DIF (Decentralized Identity Foundation), other types of DIDs are available, such as \u201cpeer\u201d DIDs that are not registered on a blockchain/DLT. The following considerations apply to \u201cclassic\u201d ledger-based DIDs: They can be called \u201comnidirectional\u201d or \u201canywise\u201d identifiers, because anyone (with read access to the DLT used for DID registration) can resolve them globally . They require privacy considerations due to certain attributes of Blockchains (e.g. immutability) which are in tension with the GDPR. They are particularly useful for DID Subjects who are Issuers of Verifiable Credentials (because Verifiable Credentials contain information about the Issuer, e.g. their DID). They are resolved using a global \u201csource of truth\u201d based on strong consistency and integrity guarantees offered by Blockchains and similar networks. The following considerations apply to \u201cpeer\u201d DIDs: They can be called \u201cunidirectional\u201d or \u201cpairwise\u201d identifiers, meaning that only one party other than the DID Subject (or a limited group of parties) can resolve them . The use of such identifiers is considered best practice under a principle known as directed identity and since they are not registered on a Blockchain there are no tensions with data protection regulations. They may have weaker consistency and integrity guarantees than \u201cclassic\u201d ledger-based DIDs (because they are not stored on a Blockchain). In order to facilitate massive onboarding of citizens, we will enable the usage of pairwise DIDs, in addition to the current ledger-based DIDs. When it is not practical or feasible to use ledger-based DIDs, the citizens will have the possibility to use pairwise DIDs. Essentially, the onboarding process consists on the creation of the SSI identity, in the form of a DID. In this use case, we do not require that citizen identities are of the highest level according to the eIDAS classification and we can start with lower levels and escalate levels later. An example using a process similar to the one used by many of the current coronavirus self-diagnostic apps is the following: (1) The citizen downloads the official app published by the health authorities. (2) and (3) Initiate the creation of the DID. (4) and (5) The mobile generates the DID locally without registering the DID in any external system (so this DID will not be anchored to any blockchain). The DID is stored in the mobile only. (6) and (7) The citizen fills a form with some personal information like name, surname and phone number. (8) and (9) The citizen provides consent to use GPS data (or not). (10) and (11) The mobile creates a self-issued credential which is stored only in the mobile. (12), (13) and (14) The citizen registers the mobile with the health authorities. The only verification method consists on sending an SMS to the mobile with an authorization code, which only verifies that the user controls the mobile but it does not verify the personal data. The health authorities send back also a BUID (Bluethooth Unique ID), to be used for the proximity tracking functionality. (15), (16) and (17) All personal data is stored in the mobile, encrypted under a password provided by the citizen. Later on (described in more detail in another section) when visiting a doctor, the doctor verifies the real identity of the citizen and then acts in the role of practitioner and issues a credential to the citizen, signed by the private key of the DID of the doctor (which can be verified by anybody with read access to the blockchain). The credential issued by the doctor will include the personal data that the citizen entered when creating her self-issued credential. The citizen will then store the credential issued by the doctor in her mobile device. She can present the credential to any other entity, and the verifier can know that a doctor issued a statement about that citizen, including the verification of her personal data. The next paragraph describes the onboarding process. For the other interactions, see the appropiate chapters. 1.1 Sequence diagram for citizen onboarding After this process, the citizen has in her mobile a self-issued credential which is not yet validated by anybody, so the trust on the included personal data is very low. However, this data will be validated to some extent when a practitioner issues a health status credential, as shown in the following diagram. 2. Practitioners and Officials In the case of doctors, the health authority of each country will issue a Verifiable Credential to the doctor, including some of the relevant information (eg. medical board number). The same applies to other types of officials, where the relevant official entity will issue credentials to all those officials.","title":"Natural persons"},{"location":"onboarding/natural_persons/#onboarding-of-natural-persons","text":"","title":"Onboarding of natural persons"},{"location":"onboarding/natural_persons/#1-citizens","text":"ESSIF-MVP1 and the current AlastriaID implementation use \u201cclassic\u201d ledger-based DIDs (i.e. DIDs registered on a Blockchain). In DIF (Decentralized Identity Foundation), other types of DIDs are available, such as \u201cpeer\u201d DIDs that are not registered on a blockchain/DLT. The following considerations apply to \u201cclassic\u201d ledger-based DIDs: They can be called \u201comnidirectional\u201d or \u201canywise\u201d identifiers, because anyone (with read access to the DLT used for DID registration) can resolve them globally . They require privacy considerations due to certain attributes of Blockchains (e.g. immutability) which are in tension with the GDPR. They are particularly useful for DID Subjects who are Issuers of Verifiable Credentials (because Verifiable Credentials contain information about the Issuer, e.g. their DID). They are resolved using a global \u201csource of truth\u201d based on strong consistency and integrity guarantees offered by Blockchains and similar networks. The following considerations apply to \u201cpeer\u201d DIDs: They can be called \u201cunidirectional\u201d or \u201cpairwise\u201d identifiers, meaning that only one party other than the DID Subject (or a limited group of parties) can resolve them . The use of such identifiers is considered best practice under a principle known as directed identity and since they are not registered on a Blockchain there are no tensions with data protection regulations. They may have weaker consistency and integrity guarantees than \u201cclassic\u201d ledger-based DIDs (because they are not stored on a Blockchain). In order to facilitate massive onboarding of citizens, we will enable the usage of pairwise DIDs, in addition to the current ledger-based DIDs. When it is not practical or feasible to use ledger-based DIDs, the citizens will have the possibility to use pairwise DIDs. Essentially, the onboarding process consists on the creation of the SSI identity, in the form of a DID. In this use case, we do not require that citizen identities are of the highest level according to the eIDAS classification and we can start with lower levels and escalate levels later. An example using a process similar to the one used by many of the current coronavirus self-diagnostic apps is the following: (1) The citizen downloads the official app published by the health authorities. (2) and (3) Initiate the creation of the DID. (4) and (5) The mobile generates the DID locally without registering the DID in any external system (so this DID will not be anchored to any blockchain). The DID is stored in the mobile only. (6) and (7) The citizen fills a form with some personal information like name, surname and phone number. (8) and (9) The citizen provides consent to use GPS data (or not). (10) and (11) The mobile creates a self-issued credential which is stored only in the mobile. (12), (13) and (14) The citizen registers the mobile with the health authorities. The only verification method consists on sending an SMS to the mobile with an authorization code, which only verifies that the user controls the mobile but it does not verify the personal data. The health authorities send back also a BUID (Bluethooth Unique ID), to be used for the proximity tracking functionality. (15), (16) and (17) All personal data is stored in the mobile, encrypted under a password provided by the citizen. Later on (described in more detail in another section) when visiting a doctor, the doctor verifies the real identity of the citizen and then acts in the role of practitioner and issues a credential to the citizen, signed by the private key of the DID of the doctor (which can be verified by anybody with read access to the blockchain). The credential issued by the doctor will include the personal data that the citizen entered when creating her self-issued credential. The citizen will then store the credential issued by the doctor in her mobile device. She can present the credential to any other entity, and the verifier can know that a doctor issued a statement about that citizen, including the verification of her personal data. The next paragraph describes the onboarding process. For the other interactions, see the appropiate chapters.","title":"1.

Practitioners and private labs can issue credentials to citizens Health practitioners will issue to citizens different types of health status situation reports as special Verifiable Credentials. The credentials issued by practitioners will be based on lab tests, vaccination, diagnostics, etc. The health condition credentials are tied to the digital identity of the issuing party. In case of practitioners this should be tied to their professional credentials, which are public and issued by the corresponding official entities (the process may depend on the specific country). All data exchanges are accompanied by a GDPR consent encoded as Verifiable Claim so that legitimate use of the data can be proved. The system allows practitioners to issue credentials to citizens directly, just using their mobile phones while on the field, for example. Without requiring complex and expensive integrations with backend systems of health institutions or other entities. The same concept should apply to private labs, in countries where this is applicable and in order to facilitate the coordination with the national health services. 2. Citizens can present their credentials to officials Communication is in general P2P (app-2-app), achieving very high levels of privacy. It includes the ability to use a simple QR based system for sending/receiving VCs to enable simple phone-to-phone verification of a credential without previous relationship among the participants. For example, when a citizen is walking in the street and an official has to verify that the citizen has the corresponding permit. The citizen can just display the QR representing the VC and the official can scan the QR and verify it. This behaves in much the same way as paper credentials but in a much more secure and convenient way. Except that health conditions can change a lot with time, so these health condition credentials will be regularly updated and timestamping will determine which is most recent. For each latest health condition credential, a QR can be generated by the citizen using a smartphone and this code can be read by another smartphone, either a practitioner, an official or other citizen. No physical contacts or pre-established relationship among parties are needed. These QRs are destroyed (as they are only digital, this means that they will not resolve any information) when a new health condition credential is created. 3. Citizens can self-attest their health status using questionnaires Citizens can self-attest their health status using questionnaires, in a similar way that is done now with some apps developed in some countries for coronavirus crisis management. These credentials are of a different nature, being self-issued and not fully verified by an authority, but they have proven to be of immense value in times of crisis. A simple verification with the mobile number, even if not legally binding, can be very useful in these situations. 4. Citizens can provide consent to use personal data Citizens can provide consent to use personal data embedded in the credentials, including the GPS coordinates in their phones for different purposes, which can range from full tracking to explicit geo-tagging of some VC when the citizen considers it adecuate (for example for self-attestation of compliance with quarantine). Some messages can be automatically collected in a central server (there may be one per country depending on the citizen), and the aggregated information from many citizens can be used and analyzed. 5. Color coding (color-blind friendly) in a safe and privacy-preserving way The information represented by these Verifiable Credentials can be used in a safe and privacy-preserving way for things like \"color coding\" citizens for their health condition regarding the infection status and places visited.
