Health and social recovery after the crisis \"In view of preparing for when the spread of the virus is under control, it is important to develop robust criteria to eventually lift \u2013 as much as possible in a coordinated manner -some of these measures and establish alternative ones to monitor and curb the expansion of the virus.\" -- European Commission\u2019s advisory panel on COVID-19 (22 March 2020) To help in times of pandemic crisis (eg. COVID-19 ) and for social recovery after the initial crisis, this application uses Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to associate immunisation & health information to citizens. We use VCs to: increase privacy and data control by the user, compared to the equivalent centralized applications developed in other regions like China or Korea, improve the interoperability and usage of this data across borders in the European Union to enable coordination (and with other regions with proper agreements), without requiring a centralized repository . The application uses a public decentralized registry to check the validity of the public identities of practitioners, professionals and institutions that may be involved. The application can be configured to verify those public identities against several such repositories, like EBSI , Alastria Red T or LaCChain . It is even possible to use centralized systems (with the condition that they be trusted). Most interactions among participants happen off-chain with high levels of privacy, scalability and flexibility. However, the citizen can provide explicit consent in the form of VCs to enable the application to send some specific information to the health authorities of each country. In addition, the application can: Provide information to health authorities to make better operational decisions through higher levels of traceability of the health status of citizens, including vaccines and vaccination procedures. Use color coded schemas for social interactions to provide information to improve protection and prevention of people during an epidemic or pandemic situation. Color coding can be more sophisticated than current schemes, thanks to the use of VCs. Use exactly the same mechanism to deliver to the citizens other useful credentials during the post-crisis recovery of the society, for example temporary permits for going to work, visiting family or travelling, both inside a country and across borders. 2. Support for health-related measures when lifting lockdown restrictions One possible future scenario is that the transmission of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (nCOV) can not be fully eliminated in the short term and so recurrent outbreaks will happen during the coming months. This is due to the high transmissibility, short incubation period and low percentage of immunized population. Even if we use effectice infection control measures, it is very probable that some cases could escape from the epidemiologic control. The risk of new outbreaks will only be reduced as people becomes more protected because they have gone through the infection and later on because the impact of generalized vaccination. In order to illustrate how mobile applications could help, a possible sequence of events could be the following: Lifting gradually the restrictions on lockdown, starting with low-risk population groups. Verifiable Credentials of different types could be used to grant permissions to different groups of people. Evaluation of the immunity of the population. This requires massive testing, in different points of control where the citizen can go either wolking or by vehicle. Verifiable Credentials with the results of the testing can be delivered at the place of testing, including a Certificate of Immunisation. Immune individuals could be issued with a kind of vaccination certificate, which would allow them to be exempted from restrictions on their activities Early detection of cases and contacts. The mobile application can allow different mechanisms, like proximity tracing or social collaboration, including self-attested health status (temparature, cough, tiredness, ...). Confinement measures if hot spots detected with monitoring. The mobile application could support during confinement of people. 3. Support for Responsible Declarations of many types In addition, in a situation of pandemia there are a lot of exceptions to the normal situation, and these exceptional procedures have to be managed.

Citizens ESSIF-MVP1 and the current AlastriaID implementation use \u201cclassic\u201d ledger-based DIDs (i.e. DIDs registered on a Blockchain). In DIF (Decentralized Identity Foundation), other types of DIDs are available, such as \u201cpeer\u201d DIDs that are not registered on a blockchain/DLT. The following considerations apply to \u201cclassic\u201d ledger-based DIDs: They can be called \u201comnidirectional\u201d or \u201canywise\u201d identifiers, because anyone (with read access to the DLT used for DID registration) can resolve them globally . They require privacy considerations due to certain attributes of Blockchains (e.g. immutability) which are in tension with the GDPR. They are particularly useful for DID Subjects who are Issuers of Verifiable Credentials (because Verifiable Credentials contain information about the Issuer, e.g. their DID). They are resolved using a global \u201csource of truth\u201d based on strong consistency and integrity guarantees offered by Blockchains and similar networks. The following considerations apply to \u201cpeer\u201d DIDs: They can be called \u201cunidirectional\u201d or \u201cpairwise\u201d identifiers, meaning that only one party other than the DID Subject (or a limited group of parties) can resolve them . The use of such identifiers is considered best practice under a principle known as directed identity and since they are not registered on a Blockchain there are no tensions with data protection regulations. They may have weaker consistency and integrity guarantees than \u201cclassic\u201d ledger-based DIDs (because they are not stored on a Blockchain). In order to facilitate massive onboarding of citizens, we will enable the usage of pairwise DIDs, in addition to the current ledger-based DIDs. When it is not practical or feasible to use ledger-based DIDs, the citizens will have the possibility to use pairwise DIDs. Essentially, the onboarding process consists on the creation of the SSI identity, in the form of a DID. In this use case, we do not require that citizen identities are of the highest level according to the eIDAS classification and we can start with lower levels and escalate levels later. An example using a process similar to the one used by many of the current coronavirus self-diagnostic apps is the following: (1) The citizen downloads the official app published by the health authorities. (2) and (3) Initiate the creation of the DID. (4) and (5) The mobile generates the DID locally without registering the DID in any external system (so this DID will not be anchored to any blockchain). The DID is stored in the mobile only. (6) and (7) The citizen fills a form with some personal information like name, surname and phone number. (8) and (9) The citizen provides consent to use GPS data (or not). (10) and (11) The mobile creates a self-issued credential which is stored only in the mobile. (12), (13) and (14) The citizen registers the mobile with the health authorities. The only verification method consists on sending an SMS to the mobile with an authorization code, which only verifies that the user controls the mobile but it does not verify the personal data. The health authorities send back also a BUID (Bluethooth Unique ID), to be used for the proximity tracking functionality. (15), (16) and (17) All personal data is stored in the mobile, encrypted under a password provided by the citizen. Later on (described in more detail in another section) when visiting a doctor, the doctor verifies the real identity of the citizen and then acts in the role of practitioner and issues a credential to the citizen, signed by the private key of the DID of the doctor (which can be verified by anybody with read access to the blockchain). The credential issued by the doctor will include the personal data that the citizen entered when creating her self-issued credential. The citizen will then store the credential issued by the doctor in her mobile device. She can present the credential to any other entity, and the verifier can know that a doctor issued a statement about that citizen, including the verification of her personal data. The next paragraph describes the onboarding process. For the other interactions, see the appropiate chapters. 1.1 Sequence diagram for citizen onboarding After this process, the citizen has in her mobile a self-issued credential which is not yet validated by anybody, so the trust on the included personal data is very low. However, this data will be validated to some extent when a practitioner issues a health status credential, as shown in the following diagram. 2.

Practitioners and private labs can issue credentials to citizens Health practitioners will issue to citizens different types of health status situation reports as special Verifiable Credentials. The credentials issued by practitioners will be based on lab tests, vaccination, diagnostics, etc. The health condition credentials are tied to the digital identity of the issuing party. In case of practitioners this should be tied to their professional credentials, which are public and issued by the corresponding official entities (the process may depend on the specific country). All data exchanges are accompanied by a GDPR consent encoded as Verifiable Claim so that legitimate use of the data can be proved. The system allows practitioners to issue credentials to citizens directly, just using their mobile phones while on the field, for example. Without requiring complex and expensive integrations with backend systems of health institutions or other entities. The same concept should apply to private labs, in countries where this is applicable and in order to facilitate the coordination with the national health services. 2. Citizens can present their credentials to officials Communication is in general P2P (app-2-app), achieving very high levels of privacy. It includes the ability to use a simple QR based system for sending/receiving VCs to enable simple phone-to-phone verification of a credential without previous relationship among the participants. For example, when a citizen is walking in the street and an official has to verify that the citizen has the corresponding permit. The citizen can just display the QR representing the VC and the official can scan the QR and verify it. This behaves in much the same way as paper credentials but in a much more secure and convenient way. Except that health conditions can change a lot with time, so these health condition credentials will be regularly updated and timestamping will determine which is most recent. For each latest health condition credential, a QR can be generated by the citizen using a smartphone and this code can be read by another smartphone, either a practitioner, an official or other citizen. No physical contacts or pre-established relationship among parties are needed. These QRs are destroyed (as they are only digital, this means that they will not resolve any information) when a new health condition credential is created. 3. Citizens can self-attest their health status using questionnaires Citizens can self-attest their health status using questionnaires, in a similar way that is done now with some apps developed in some countries for coronavirus crisis management. These credentials are of a different nature, being self-issued and not fully verified by an authority, but they have proven to be of immense value in times of crisis. A simple verification with the mobile number, even if not legally binding, can be very useful in these situations. 4. Citizens can provide consent to use personal data Citizens can provide consent to use personal data embedded in the credentials, including the GPS coordinates in their phones for different purposes, which can range from full tracking to explicit geo-tagging of some VC when the citizen considers it adecuate (for example for self-attestation of compliance with quarantine). Some messages can be automatically collected in a central server (there may be one per country depending on the citizen), and the aggregated information from many citizens can be used and analyzed. 5. Color coding (color-blind friendly) in a safe and privacy-preserving way The information represented by these Verifiable Credentials can be used in a safe and privacy-preserving way for things like \"color coding\" citizens for their health condition regarding the infection status and places visited.
